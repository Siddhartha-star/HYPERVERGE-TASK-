# Backend Design Document

## 1. System Architecture
- Overall system overview and how backend components interact.
- Microservices vs. Monolithic architecture (current state and future considerations).
- High-level component diagram.

## 2. Data Model
- Database schema design (PostgreSQL).
- Key entities and their relationships (ERD or textual description).
- Data validation and integrity.

## 3. API Design
- RESTful API principles.
- API endpoints and their functionalities (e.g., `/users`, `/courses`, `/tasks`).
- Request and response formats (JSON).
- Error handling (standard error response format).
- Versioning strategy.

## 4. Authentication and Authorization
- User authentication mechanism (e.g., JWT, OAuth2).
- Role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC).
- Secure token storage and management.

## 5. Security Considerations
- Input validation and sanitization.
- Protection against common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10).
- Data encryption (at rest and in transit).
- API rate limiting and DDoS protection.
- Secure configuration management.

## 6. Scalability and Performance
- Strategies for horizontal and vertical scaling.
- Caching mechanisms.
- Database indexing and query optimization.
- Load balancing considerations.

## 7. Logging and Monitoring
- Centralized logging (e.g., ELK stack, Grafana Loki).
- Monitoring key metrics (e.g., CPU, memory, request latency, error rates).
- Alerting mechanisms.

## 8. Deployment and Infrastructure
- Deployment environment (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes).
- CI/CD pipeline.
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) considerations.

## 9. Technologies Used
- Programming languages (Python).
- Frameworks (FastAPI).
- Database (PostgreSQL).
- Other tools and libraries.
